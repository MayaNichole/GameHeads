# Soul Ties, Sole Tied
### *Free the souls. Untie the soles*

In Soul Ties, Sole Tied, you play as a spirit guide helping restless ghosts move on. Each soul you meet is bound to the world by glowing strings that represent regret, grief, or memory. Through quiet exploration and gentle, puzzle-like unraveling, you free them from what holds them back.

After release, each ghost becomes a musical thread on your celestial harp. Playing their string creates a melody that echoes their story. As more souls find peace, your harp grows into a complete song of remembrance and release.
