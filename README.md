# Soul Ties, Sole Tied
### *Free the souls. Untie the soles*

In Soul Ties, Sole Tied, you play as a spirit guide helping restless ghosts move on. Each soul you meet is bound to the world by glowing strings that represent regret, grief, or memory. Through gentle exploration and unraveling puzzle-like knots, you free these spirits from what holds them back.

After release, each ghost becomes a musical thread on your funky bass guitar. Playing their string creates a melody that echoes their story. As more souls find peace, your harp grows into a complete song of remembrance and release.
